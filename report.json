However, it has happened that different implementation have the same bug, so it's best to read the [standard document](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/), and to check what _should_ happen.\n\nFeature requests are welcome, but a quick search in the [opened and closed issues](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/issues) is welcome to avoid duplicates.\n\nPull requests are also welcome, but any change to the standard (barring things like typos and the like) will have to be discussed in an issue (and possibly during a call, accessible only to W3C Audio Working Group members).\n\n[Bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) is the tool used to write this\nspecification.

You may also want to read [how the spec is built](https://github.com/w3c/html/blob/master/docs/build-documentation.md).\n\nEditorial improvements are welcome, just make a [Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/w3c/html/pulls)! You may encounter a warning about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) commitments if you are not a member of the W3C [Web Platform Working Group (WebPlat WG)](https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/), but this will be handled by the WebPlat WG editorial team. Specific concerns about IPR and the W3C may be found in the [Intellectual Rights FAQ](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html).\n\nYour concern might already be known. Before beginning work, check [the issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues) to see if there are any existing discussions about the issue. If you want to help but are unsure how to begin, some issues are marked as [good first issues](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or [help wanted](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). These might be good places to start. \n\nProposals for new elements are best discussed on the [WICG Discourse](https://discourse.wicg.io/).\n\nTo make **substantive** contributions, changes that clarify or update conformance requirements, you must either participate in the W3C [Web Platform Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/) or make a [non-member patent licensing commitment](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/83482/nmlc). \nThis is because the W3C Patent Policy depends on granting licenses for the [essential claims](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#def-essential) needed to implement the spec. A list of [previous substantive contributions](https://github.com/w3c/html/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed+label%3Asubstantive) can be found on the issue tracker.\n\nIf your contribution includes the work of others, please see [Contributing Documentation](https://github.com/w3c/html/blob/master/docs/contributing-documentation.md) for further guidance.\n\n## Tests\n\nFor **substantive changes**, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) PR is highly appreciated. The W3C defines a normative change as edits that affect the formal part of the Recommendation, rules that everyone must follow. **Non-substantive** changes affect supplementary information and guidance for these rules.\n\nTypically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/new) to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n\n## Language and Terminology\n\nIt may help to familiarize yourself with the specific language used by the W3C HTML Recommendation.
